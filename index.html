We collected and processed live footage and videos of obstructions causing railway accidents. Using YOLOv8 with additional CNN layers, we trained a model to detect obstacles efficiently. The model achieved a high performance with an average precision (AP) of 93.9% and a low confidence limit of 0.25, performing well in diverse weather conditions. Our work was accepted for publication in the Springer Year Book and presented at the International Conference for Machine Intelligence, Tools, and Applications 2024, organized by VIT Bhopal University.
